        m_Untranslated: 'You''ve made a lot of updates to your monster car so far.
          Have you been testing it out in Play mode along the way?


          If
          not, select the play button in Unity to enter Play mode. Observe your vehicle''s
          behavior. How does it respond to gravity? How well are the wheel colliders
          keeping your vehicle above the ground?


          You can adjust GameObject
          parameters and more in the Inspector window while in Play mode, but the
          changes you make won''t save. Use this as a chance to try out different
          values for properties that''ll improve your game scene.


          Remember
          to continue testing your monster car scene by jumping into Play mode every
          now and again. To exit Play mode, select the play button again and continue
          updating your scene.'

        m_Untranslated: Adjust Wheel Collider Component Properties
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: 'For each of your wheel collider GameObjects, you can adjust
          various properties in the Wheel Collider component.


          1. In each
          Wheel Collider component, you can change the values for mass, radius, wheel
          damping rate, suspension distance, how the suspension springs respond,
          and friction applied to the wheels.


          2. Review the properties
          available under the Wheel Collider component. Many of these properties
          will work fine using the default values for now.


          NOTE: If you
          notice your vehicle tipping over easily or not accelerating fast enough
          while driving later, you might consider increasing or decreasing each wheel
          collider''s Mass value or the Monster Car Rigidbody Mass parameter. You
          might also need to increase or decrease each wheel collider''s Suspension
          Spring value to give your vehicle more or less bounce while driving.


          It''s
          important to test out your monster car''s driving performance after you''ve
          added the Vehicle Controls C# script. The Wheel Collider properties listed
          above might need adjusted based on the size and shape of your vehicle.


          After
          you''ve reviewed the Wheel Collider properties, select the Next button
          to add a box collider.'
