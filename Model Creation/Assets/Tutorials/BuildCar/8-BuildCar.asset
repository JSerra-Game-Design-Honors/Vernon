        m_Untranslated: Building Wheel Meshes
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: '1. Create a new Cylinder GameObject by right-clicking any
          empty area of the Hierarchy window.


          2. Adjust the radius/height
          of Cylinder in the Inspector window or Scene editor, using the Transform
          tool, until it looks like one wheel for your vehicle.


          3. Rename
          Cylinder to Wheel.


          4. Create a second Cylinder GameObject as
          a child of Wheel by right-clicking on Wheel in the Hierarchy window and
          selecting Cylinder.


          5. Rename your second cylinder from Cylinder
          to Rim.


          6. Position Rim inside Wheel in the Scene editor with
          a smaller radius as Wheel.


          7. Adjust the height of Rim so that
          one end of the cylinder is slightly visible beyond one end of Wheel, but
          not visible on the other end of Wheel.


          NOTE: For two-wheeled
          vehicles, such as a monster motorcycle, you may want your Rim cylinder
          to protrude both faces of the Wheel cylinder to show the rim on both sides
          of the tires.


          8. Remove the Capsule Collider (or any other
          collider) component from each wheel mesh GameObject. This is important
          since they will interfere with your Wheel Colliders and the driving script
          later.


          9. Open the Materials folder in the Project window.


          Some
          wheel materials have been provided for you to use for a tire and rim.


          10.
          Drag the Tires material onto your Wheel GameObject.


          11. Drag
          the Rims material onto your Rim GameObject.


          Select the Next
          button to build more wheels for your vehicle.'
