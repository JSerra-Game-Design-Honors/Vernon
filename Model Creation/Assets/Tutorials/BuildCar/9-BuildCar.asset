      Text:
        m_Untranslated: You'll make the Wheel GameObject, with Rim as a child, a
          prefab that can be used to create multiple wheels for your vehicle. Remember
          that you need at least two driveable wheels. Be careful with your Monster
          Car hierarchy as you continue buidling your vehicle.

        m_Untranslated: Wheel Prefab
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: '1. Now open the Prefabs folder in the Project window.


          2.
          Left-click the Wheel GameObject in the Hierarchy window and drag it into
          the Prefabs folder in the Project window.


          NOTE: You''ve now
          created a prefab of your vehicle''s wheels. You can change the textures
          or dimensions of all your wheels by simply editing this single prefab at
          any time.


          3. Once your Wheel prefab appears in the Prefabs
          folder, delete Wheel GameObject in the Hierarchy window by right-clicking
          it and selecting Delete.


          4. Use your prefab to create as many
          wheels as you need by dragging the Wheel prefab into the Scene editor or
          Hierarchy window.


          REMINDER: You must have at least two driveable
          wheels on your vehicle.


          5. Reposition your Wheel GameObjects
          using the Transform and Rotation tools as needed. Continue placing your
          wheels onto your chassis in the Scene editor until your monster car appears
          as you intended.


          6. Rename your Wheel GameObjects appropriately
          in the Hierarchy window. For example, FrontLeftWheel, RearLeftWheel, etc.
          This is important to control the meshes later with a script.


          7.
          If you haven''t done so yet, make sure each wheel GameObject you created
          with the prefab is a child of the Meshes GameObject in the Hierarchy window.
          (Remember that Meshes is a child GameObject of Wheels.)


          When
          your monster car appears as you intended, save your Scene and Project.

          your project with your teacher and complete the tutorial questions in the
          CodeHS editor.
