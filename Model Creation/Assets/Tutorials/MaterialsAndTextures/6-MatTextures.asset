      Text:
        m_Untranslated: 'Textures are 2D images you can create in a drawing application
          or with a photo. You''ll apply a texture of your choice to the plane in
          your monster car scene. Some various road and cobblestone surface images
          have been added to the Textures folder to get you started, but you can
          add other images as textures to the driving surface for your monster car.


          While
          textures are flat and 2D, they can also appear as a 3D element known as
          a material - similar to the flat tire texture you applied to your wheels
          as a material.'

        m_Untranslated: '1. Open the Textures folder in the Project window and find
          the tires texture. That''s a 2D image.


          2. Now open the Materials
          folder in the Project window.


          3. Find the Tires material. Materials
          use textures and shaders to describe the appearance of a surface.


          NOTE:
          Materials allow light to reflect off of textures or surfaces of 3D GameObjects.
          They can give the appearance of 3D surfaces. You don''t need to add a texture
          to a material. You can create new materials that just have color attributes
          applied to them.


          Select the Start button to begin adding some
          materials and textures to your monster car scene.'
